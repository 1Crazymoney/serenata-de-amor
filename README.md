![Operação Serenata de Amor](logo.png)

Serenata de Amor is an open project using data science for social accountability of public expenses. We use technology just like large organizations such as Google, Facebook and Netflix in order to track government spendings and to make open data accessible for everyone.

Serenata has created Rosie: an artificial intelligence who analyzes Brazilian congresspeople expenses while they are in office. Rosie can find suspicious spendings and engage citizens in the discussion about these findings.

To allow people to visualize and make sense of data Rosie generates, we have created Jarbas. In this website users can browse congresspeople expenses and get details about each one of the suspicions. It is the starting point to validate a suspicion.

## Support Serenata de Amor

In 2016, precisely on the September 7th, our [first crowdfunding](https://catarse.me/serenata) campaign was launched and we raised approximately R$ 80,000 – 30% more than our initial target. That allowed us to afford the dedicated team for the first 90 days.

At that time, we developed Rosie and made our first joint complaint, with 629 cases reported to the Chamber. Without recurrence, however, we can not continue the work. That is why we have created a space for people who want to contribute frequently, even with minor values, to our project. However we want to go further — if you wanna make us go further:
